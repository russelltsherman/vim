| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| :w                   | write your changes to the file                             |
| :q!                  | get out of vim (quit), but without saving your changes (!) |
| :wq                  | write your changes and exit vim                            |

| ZZ                   | a faster way to do `:wq`                                   |
